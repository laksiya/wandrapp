## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

**🔧 Project Setup**
- [x] Next.js 15 with App Router
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Tailwind CSS with custom styling

- [x] `addToItinerary()` - Add vault items to calendar
- [x] `moveItinerary()` - Move/resize calendar events
- [x] `deleteItinerary()` - Remove calendar events
- [x] `getVaultItems()` - Fetch activities
- [x] `getItineraryItems()` - Fetch calendar events

**🤖 AI Integration**

- [x] Fallback handling for API errors

**💾 Database Integration**
- [x] Neon PostgreSQL client setup
- [x] Complete database schema in DATAMODEL.md

- [x] Image upload with proper validation

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Directory Structure:**
```
app/trip/[tripId]/
├── page.tsx        # Main UI with DnD Provider
├── actions.ts      # All server actions
components/
├── UploadButton.tsx
├── VaultList.tsx
└── CalendarBoard.tsx
lib/
├── db.ts          # Database types & client
└── openai.ts      # AI parsing logic
```

**Key Technologies:**
- Next.js 15 Server Actions (no API routes needed)
- React DnD for drag & drop
- React Big Calendar for scheduling
- OpenAI GPT-4o Vision for image parsing
- Neon PostgreSQL for data storage
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### 🎯 Ready for Next Steps

**Immediate Development Tasks:**
1. Set up `.env.local` with your credentials
2. Create Neon database and run SQL from DATAMODEL.md
3. Add OpenAI API key
4. Test upload and drag & drop functionality

**Environment Setup Required:**
- DATABASE_URL (Neon PostgreSQL)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (OpenAI)
- Optional: GCP credentials for production

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Upload**: User drops screenshot → Server processes with OpenAI Vision → Saves to vault
2. **Plan**: User drags activities from vault → Drops on calendar → Creates itinerary item
3. **Organize**: User moves/resizes events → Updates database → Real-time UI updates

### 📱 Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Vault (33%) | Calendar (67%) side-by-side
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with drag & drop instructions

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

- Configured for Vercel deployment
- Environment variables documented
- Production GCS integration ready
