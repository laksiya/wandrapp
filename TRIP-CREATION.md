/trip/[tripId]       → Individual trip workspace (existing, enhanced)
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Server Actions Added:**
- `createTrip(name: string)` - Creates new trip with UUID
- `getTrip(tripId: string)` - Fetches trip details and validates existence

### **Components Created:**
- `Header.tsx` - Global navigation with trip context
- Enhanced trip page with error states and trip name display

### **Database Schema:** 
Already supports trips via existing `trips` table with:
- `id` (UUID primary key)
- `name` (trip name)
- `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps

## 🚀 **How Trip Creation Works**

1. **User visits homepage** (`/`) 
   - See landing page with "Create New Trip" button

2. **Click "Create New Trip"** 
   - Navigate to `/create` form

3. **Enter trip name and submit**
   - Server creates new trip with UUID
   - Redirects to `/trip/[new-uuid]`

4. **Start planning**
   - Upload screenshots, build itinerary
   - Share trip URL with travel companions

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

```
Homepage → Create Trip → Trip Workspace → Share & Collaborate
   ↓           ↓             ↓               ↓
Landing    Trip Name    Upload Photos   Copy Link
  Page       Form       Drag & Drop    Collaboration
```

## 🔗 **Sharing & Collaboration**

- **Unique URLs**: Each trip gets a shareable URL like `/trip/abc-123-def`
- **Copy Link**: One-click copy from header menu
- **Anonymous**: No authentication required - anyone with link can collaborate
- **Real-time**: Changes visible on page refresh (as per MVP spec)

1. ✅ Create custom-named trips
